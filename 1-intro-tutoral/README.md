## Intro tutorial web app

This directory contains the code from [Part 1](https://dev.to/andyhaskell/build-a-basic-web-app-with-indexeddb-38ef) of my Build a Basic Web App with IndexedDB tutorial series, where we look at the basics of IndexedDB object stores, callbacks, and adding and retrieving data.

All of the database and page logic is found in `db.js`.

To try out the web app with this code, run:

```
yarn install
yarn serve
```

You can then try out the web app at `localhost:1123`.
